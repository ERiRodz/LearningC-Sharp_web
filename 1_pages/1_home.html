                C# is a modern object-oriented, general-purpose programming language, created and developed by Microsoft together with the .NET platform. C# is a high-level language that is similar to Java and C++ and, to some extent, languages like Delphi, VB.NET and C. All C# programs are object-oriented. They consist of a set of definitions in classes that contain methods and the methods contain the program logic – the instructions which the computer executes. The C# language and the .NET platform are maintained and managed entirely by Microsoft and are not open to third parties. The C# language is distributed together with a special environment on which it is executed, called the <a class="link_text" href="5_terminology.html#Common Language Runtime (CLR)" target="_blank">Common Language Runtime (CLR)</a>.<br>
